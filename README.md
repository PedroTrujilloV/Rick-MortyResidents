Rick&amp;MortyResidents is a test app that presents the residents information by location. This app uses https://rickandmortyapi.com as data source

### Technologies and APIs used:

·     MVVM
·     UICollectionView
·     UICollectionViewCell
·     UIViewController
·     UICollectionViewFlowLayout
·     URLSession
·     RESTful JSON API
·     Image caching 
·     Pagination
·     Generics
·     Delegation
·     Callbacks 
·     Dark mode dynamic colors 
·     Unit Testing
·     etc.

### Instructions for running the app:
Necessary to have Xcode installed before. Download the repository, once downloaded open the xcodeproj file, and run it. If the build phase fails, make sure you have a simulator selected, or a real device ( iPhone or iPad ) connected, also make sure you have configured the team and the bundle identifier. 

### Pending or nice to have:

·     More unit testing
·     UI testing
·     Packages for common components
·     Test and improve the image caching 



## Project
Build an app that connects to the Rick & Morty API. The app should do the following:

Retrieve a list of locations (name and type), along with the residents of that location and their status.
Display the data in a manner that allows you to view the location, its' residents and see an image of the resident with a representation of their name & status.
When you tap on a resident it will navigate to a screen with the resident's details. On this screen you will be able to open a form that allows you to add your notes about the character.

This form will post to a dummy API endpoint using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide that you must create.
Alternatively, you may use an API endpoint of your choosing or creation if that suits you.

### Guidelines
Choose the GraphQL or REST endpoint and communicate your choice and why
You may use  Expo, Vanilla React Native or Native, although preferably we are getting the opportunity to review your JavaScript capabilities, it doesn't have to be perfect!
Send us an invite to your private Github repository when completed, details below.
Commit early & often this shows us your process

### Deliverables
Upon completion, invite jenn@echobind.com to a private GitHub repo. Then email me and mention how long the test took, anything worth calling out, and any feedback on the test itself worth noting.

Good luck, and have fun.
